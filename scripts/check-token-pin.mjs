/**
 * G3 — the `@kaleem/tokens` pin must agree with the `tokens` submodule.
 *
 * THESE ARE INDEPENDENT, and that is the trap. pnpm installs the package from
 * its git URL at the ref in package.json; the submodule checkout exists only so
 * the source is readable and the contrast gate has data to read. Bumping one
 * without the other produces a tree that looks coherent, reviews clean, and
 * installs the OLD palette.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It is finding T5 in the design-system v2 audit: the
 * package said 0.1.0 while the consumed tag was v0.1.1. And it recurred in a
 * different form on 2026-09-12, when the LOCAL dev container held v0.1.0 for
 * days after the v2 swap -- every local visual check was against the old palette
 * and nothing said so, because nothing compared the two.
 *
 * Three things are asserted:
 *   1. Every consumer pins the same ref (a half-done bump).
 *   2. That ref is a real tag in the submodule, and the submodule's committed
 *      gitlink is exactly that tag's commit (the T5 drift).
 *   3. No `link:` override is committed -- the local-iteration workaround that
 *      hot-reloads token edits. It resolves to no tag at all, so a tree
 *      carrying one installs whatever happens to be on disk.
