# Stripe billing runbook

Operational steps for the `billing` module (`docs/architecture/billing.md`). Stripe
**test mode** only — no live keys exist yet (go-live is a separate launch task).

## 1. Stripe test-mode Price setup

1. In the Stripe dashboard (test mode), create two recurring Prices, monthly billing
   period:
   - **Individual** — one adult student, 4 sessions/month.
   - **Family** — one parent, 4 sessions/child/month.
2. Copy each Price's id (`price_…`).
3. In Django admin, create the matching `SubscriptionPlan` rows with the **same**
   amount/currency as the Stripe Price:
   - `plan_type`: `individual` or `family`.
   - `sessions_per_cycle`: 4 (or whatever the product spec currently says).
   - `stripe_price_id`: the `price_…` id copied above.
   - `display_amount`: the Price's amount in minor units (e.g. cents).
   - `currency`: the Price's currency, lowercase ISO-4217 (Stripe convention).
   - `is_active`: true.

Plan/Price creation is manual — there is no programmatic sync in B1 (see `ISSUES.md`).
Keep `display_amount`/`currency` in lockstep with the Stripe Price by hand; a mismatch
only affects what the pricing page *shows*, not what Stripe actually charges.

## 2. Environment variables

| Var | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DJANGO_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | local `.env`, staging `.env.production` | Stripe **test** secret key (`sk_test_…`). Never commit. |
| `DJANGO_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | local `.env`, staging `.env.production` | The signing secret for the registered webhook endpoint (`whsec_…`). Never commit. |
| `DJANGO_STRIPE_API_VERSION` | **required in every environment** | The Stripe API version. **Set it explicitly** — see below. Staging is on `2026-08-26.dahlia`. |

> **Always set `DJANGO_STRIPE_API_VERSION`.** This runbook used to say "leave it unset, the
> default is read off the installed SDK". That was wrong, and it bit us: on 2026-09-03 the
> SDK default moved from `2026-07-29.dahlia` to `2026-08-26.dahlia` **between two deploys on
> the same day**, because `requirements/base.txt` allows `stripe>=15.5,<16.0` and the rebuild
> picked up 15.6.1. Unset, the inbound webhook payload shape is decided by Stripe's release
> calendar and whenever you last rebuilt — and it must match the version the webhook endpoint
> was *created* at, which cannot be changed afterwards (§3). Pin both sides yourself.

Both secrets default to `""` in `config/settings/base.py` (local/dev convenience) but are
**required** (`env(...)`, no default) in `config/settings/production.py` — a missing
value fails startup rather than silently accepting unsigned webhooks.

> **Migrating an older `.env`.** These variables were renamed to carry the `DJANGO_`
> prefix used by every other setting in this project. An `.env.production` still holding
> the un-prefixed `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` will fail startup with
> `ImproperlyConfigured: Set the DJANGO_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY environment variable` — that is
> the rename, not a lost secret. Rename the keys in place (values unchanged) and restart.

On the staging VPS these live in `.env.production`, managed directly on the box — same
as `DJANGO_FRONTEND_URL`. CI does not sync or know about them; update them over SSH and
restart the stack if either value changes.

## 3. Register the webhook endpoint

In the Stripe dashboard (test mode), add a webhook endpoint:

```text
https://api-staging.kaleem.academy/api/v1/billing/webhook/
```

Subscribe it to exactly these eight event types (this is the full set
`_EVENT_HANDLERS` in `billing/services.py` understands — anything else is logged and
acked with no effect):

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`
- `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`
- `checkout.session.expired`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.paid`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

The three `checkout.session.*` events beyond `completed` matter for
delayed-notification payment methods (SEPA debit, ACH, boleto). Those complete the
session with `payment_status="unpaid"` and the subscription `incomplete`; kaleem
grants nothing until `async_payment_succeeded` arrives. Without them subscribed, a
customer paying by bank debit is charged and never gets access.

**Pin the endpoint's API version — at creation, because it cannot be changed later.**
`WebhookEndpoint` accepts `api_version` only on *create*; the update call ignores it. Getting
this wrong is therefore not a config edit but a full rotation: create a replacement endpoint,
move `DJANGO_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on the VPS to its new signing secret, restart, then delete
the old endpoint. Order matters — keep the old endpoint alive until the new secret is live, or
you drop deliveries. (Both endpoints running briefly is safe: same event id, and
`StripeEventLog` dedupes.)

Set it to the same value as `DJANGO_STRIPE_API_VERSION` (§2) — **not** to whatever the SDK
happens to default to today, which moves with the dependency. Staging: `2026-08-26.dahlia`.

An endpoint registered with *no* version inherits the account default, and Stripe changes
that default over time. Payload shapes are versioned: `2025-03-31.basil`, for example,
moved a subscription's `current_period_end` onto `items.data[].current_period_end` and an
invoice's `subscription` to `parent.subscription_details.subscription`. The parser
tolerates both shapes, but pinning is what makes the payload predictable rather than a
function of Stripe's release calendar. When you upgrade the `stripe` dependency, re-check
this endpoint's version against the new SDK pin.

Copy the endpoint's signing secret into `DJANGO_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on staging.

## 3b. Configure the billing portal

`POST /api/v1/billing/portal/` opens a Stripe-hosted portal session. This is the only
self-serve way out of a failed payment — `past_due` and `unpaid` subscriptions count as
*live*, so they block starting a new subscription, and without a working portal the
customer is locked out of the product and out of the fix at the same time.

Stripe dashboard → Settings → Billing → Customer portal:

- **Payment methods:** allow customers to update.
- **Invoice history:** on.
- **Cancellation:** allow, *at end of billing period* (matches
  `cancel_subscription`, which is cancel-at-period-end).
- **Subscription update:** on, with both plan Prices listed as switchable products.
  Set proration to **create prorations** for upgrades and **at period end** for
  downgrades (the decision recorded in the B2 spec, OQ-B2-2).

⚠ This configuration is *not* in code and CI cannot check it. A portal with
subscription-update switched off silently removes the plan-change path; a portal with
cancellation set to "immediately" would cut access the customer has already paid for.
Re-check it after any Stripe account change.

The set of Prices a given user may switch to is still enforced server-side —
`_allowed_plans_for` mirrors `_require_eligible_buyer`, so a linked child is offered
nothing and a non-parent is never offered Family.

## 3c. Scheduled jobs

Two Celery beat tasks, declared in `config/settings/base.py` so they are reviewable in
code rather than only in the beat database:

| Task | Schedule | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `billing.tasks.reconcile_subscriptions` | nightly 03:17 | Asks Stripe for every customer's subscriptions and makes kaleem agree. Records a `reconciled_drift` incident per correction. |
| `billing.tasks.detect_webhook_silence` | every 6h | Raises a CRITICAL `webhook_silence` incident when no Stripe event has arrived within `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SILENCE_HOURS` (default 24). |

Both are safe to run by hand during an incident:

```bash
python manage.py shell -c "from kaleem.billing import services; services.reconcile_subscriptions()"
```

The reconciler is what makes **Stripe** the source of truth rather than webhook
delivery. If it stops running, kaleem silently goes back to being only as correct as
the last webhook that happened to arrive.

## 3d. The incident queue

Django admin → Billing → Billing incidents. Everything that needs a human lands here
instead of only in a log line: duplicate live subscriptions, unresolvable events,
unknown subscriptions or prices, amount mismatches, reconciliation drift, webhook
silence.

- Filter by **severity = critical** and **resolved = no** first. `critical` means money
  is wrong right now.
- Rows are read-only except for the **Mark selected incidents resolved** action.
  Resolving is only a flag — the actual fix happens in the Stripe dashboard.
- A repeating problem shows as one row with a rising `occurrences` count. Once
  resolved, the next occurrence opens a fresh row.

## 4. Local development

Use the Stripe CLI to forward events to your local backend:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://api.kaleem.localhost/api/v1/billing/webhook/
```

`stripe listen` prints a `whsec_…` signing secret for this session — put it in your
local `.env` as `DJANGO_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and restart the backend so it picks up
the new value. Trigger test events (e.g. `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`) or
drive the flow through the real `/billing` UI with a test card.

## 5. Manual staging test (D9)

The hosted-Stripe redirect can't run in Playwright (`ISSUES.md`), so this is the
required manual verification before calling B1 done:

1. Log in as a parent (or an adult student not linked as a child) on staging.
2. Go to `/billing`. Click **Subscribe** on a plan.
3. On Stripe's hosted checkout, pay with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future
   expiry date, any CVC, any postal code.
4. Confirm — Stripe redirects back to `/billing?checkout=success`. The page shows a
   "finishing up…" state while it polls `GET me/subscription/`.
5. Once the webhook lands, the page flips to the active subscription card (status,
   renewal date).
6. Click **Cancel** → confirm in the dialog. The card should now read
   "cancels on `{period_end}`".
7. In the Stripe dashboard, open the subscription and verify `cancel_at_period_end` is
   set to `true`.

If step 4 times out, refresh — the fallback message tells the user webhook delivery may
take a moment; check `stripe listen` (local) or the endpoint's delivery log (staging) for
a failed delivery before assuming a bug.

## 6. Incident: duplicate live subscription

**Symptom.** A `duplicate_live_subscription` row in the incident queue (severity
`critical`), and a `CRITICAL` log line:

```text
billing.webhook.duplicate_live_subscription reason=… user_id=… existing_subscription=sub_… incoming_subscription=sub_… event_id=…
```

**What it means.** Stripe reported a second live subscription for a user who already has
one — most often the user opened checkout in two tabs and completed both. `reason` says
which defence caught it: `pre_write_check` (the service read the existing row first) or
`db_constraint` (the read lost a race and the
`unique_live_subscription_per_user` constraint caught the insert).

**What kaleem did.** Nothing beyond refusing to record the second subscription. It did
**not** cancel or refund anything in Stripe, and it acked the webhook 200 on purpose (a
non-2xx would make Stripe retry a request that can never succeed, for three days). The
customer's account still shows exactly one subscription.

**What you must do.** The customer is very likely being billed twice by Stripe right now,
and only Stripe knows it. This needs a human — which subscription to void and whether to
refund is a money decision the webhook handler must not make silently.

1. Open the Stripe dashboard → Customers → the user (`user_id` in the log line maps to
   `BillingCustomer.user`; the customer id is on that row, read-only in Django admin).
2. Confirm both `existing_subscription` and `incoming_subscription` are live in Stripe.
3. Decide which to keep — normally the one kaleem has recorded (`existing_subscription`),
   so the app and Stripe agree without any local edit.
4. Cancel the other **immediately** (not at period end) in Stripe, and refund the charge
   it has already taken if the customer paid for it.
5. If you instead keep `incoming_subscription`, you must also fix the local row: cancel
   `existing_subscription` in Stripe, then update the `Subscription` row in Django admin
   to the surviving `stripe_subscription_id`. Do this only if there is a reason to; the
   simple path is step 3.
6. Mark the incident resolved in Django admin, and note it in the journal. A rising
   `occurrences` count on one row means the same duplicate keeps being re-reported;
   repeated *distinct* incidents mean something is letting users open two checkouts,
   which is a bug to fix rather than an incident to keep clearing.

Related: the `unique_live_subscription_per_user` constraint is added by migration
`billing/0003` and widened by `billing/0004` to cover `unpaid` and `incomplete` as well
as `active` and `past_due`. If either migration fails to apply, it is because a user
already has two live rows — reconcile them in Stripe (above) and fix the rows before
deploying.

## 7. Incident: webhook silence

**Symptom.** A `webhook_silence` incident, severity `critical`.

**What it means.** No Stripe event has reached us for longer than
`BILLING_WEBHOOK_SILENCE_HOURS`. Usually the endpoint secret was rotated, the endpoint
was deleted or disabled in Stripe, or the API host has been unreachable long enough for
Stripe to give up retrying.

**What to check, in order.**

1. Stripe dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → the endpoint. Is it enabled? Are recent
   deliveries failing, and with what status?
2. If deliveries show `400 Invalid webhook signature`, the signing secret no longer
   matches `DJANGO_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Copy it again and redeploy.
3. If deliveries show 5xx, read the application logs for that window.
4. Once fixed, **run the reconciler by hand** (§3c). Stripe will not resend events it
   has given up on, so anything lost during the silence is only recoverable by
   reconciling.

**What kaleem did meanwhile.** Checkouts completed in the browser still settled, because
`POST /billing/checkout/settle/` asks Stripe directly rather than waiting to be told.
Everything *after* checkout — renewals, failed cards, cancellations — was not applied
until the reconciler next ran.

## 8. Incident: amount mismatch

**Symptom.** An `amount_mismatch` incident, severity `critical`, with `expected_*` and
`charged_*` in its detail.

**What it means.** Stripe charged something other than what the plan says it sells —
almost always a `SubscriptionPlan.stripe_price_id` pointing at the wrong Price, or a
Price edited in the Stripe dashboard without the plan being updated.

**What kaleem did.** Recorded the subscription anyway. The customer *was* charged;
refusing to record it would leave them paying for nothing.

**What you must do.** Decide which side is wrong. If the Price is right and the plan row
is stale, fix `display_amount`/`currency`/`stripe_price_id` in Django admin. If the plan
is right and the customer was overcharged, refund the difference in Stripe. Then resolve
the incident.
