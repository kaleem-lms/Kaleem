## Goal

One paragraph: what and why.

## User flow

Step by step, from the user's POV. Include error cases.

## Data model delta

New tables, new fields, new relationships. Include a mini ERD.

## API delta

New endpoints, changed endpoints, removed endpoints. Request/response shape.

## Module boundaries

Which module owns this? What other modules does it call? Any new events?

## Out of scope

What this spec explicitly does NOT do.

## Test plan

Happy path + edge cases + failure cases that must pass.

## Open questions

Must be resolved before implementation begins.
