# kaleem Project State

## Current phase: Phase A — Identity

## Active spec

docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-identity-module.md

## Phase A identity — DONE ✅ (DoD fully closed 2026-06-10)

All 8 plan steps implemented with TDD (78 tests; models.py 93% / services.py 96%
coverage; ruff + mypy + import-linter green). Spec + plan shipped/done. Backend is
live on staging and the previously-broken register flow now works.

**Staging is green and functional.** A live smoke test first found
`POST /api/identity/register/` → 500 (production had no email config: SMTP defaulted
to localhost:25). Fixed with env-driven SMTP + AWS SES (ADR-0016); deployed via #39.
Live re-test on `staging.kaleem.academy`: register → **201** (SES sends, out of
sandbox), login-before-verify → **400 not verified**, unauth mutation → **403**. The
full verified flow (verify→login→/me→child→invite→accept) is proven locally on the
identical code; on staging the verification link now lands in a real inbox via SES, so
the final click-through is a human check (register with a real address).

Note: two throwaway test users exist in the staging DB (`stg.smoke@example.com`,
`ses.smoke@example.com`) from smoke testing — clear them via admin or on the next DB
reset.

Definition-of-Done:

- ✅ Golden-path smoke test over real HTTP against the live dev stack (real CSRF,
  sessions, and allauth verification via the console email backend): register parent →
  confirm email → login → GET /me/ → add child → create invite, then register adult
  student → confirm → login → accept invite (`linked: true`).
- ✅ Edge cases: unverified login → 400; invalid invite code → typed 400; authenticated
  mutation without CSRF → 403. (Anonymous register without CSRF returns 201 — confirmed
  standard DRF SessionAuthentication behaviour, not a bug.)
- ✅ Admin teacher flow: superuser logs into Django admin → selects teacher → "Send
  password-set email" action → teacher receives a reset email. (`create_teacher_account`
  service also unit-tested.) Note: the eventual teacher-create UX lives in the React
  dashboard, not Django admin — see docs/adr/0013-custom-admin-dashboard.md.
- ✅ Architecture doc `docs/architecture/identity.md`.
- ✅ Weekly journal entry `docs/superpowers/journal/2026-W24.md`.

- ✅ Staging deploy. `develop → master` (#33) deployed green via the `deploy-staging`
  job: backend image built + pushed to GHCR, SSH to VPS, blue-green via
  `infra/scripts/ship.sh`. First attempt failed at `migrate` on stale staging-DB
  migration history (`account.0001` before `identity.0001`); resolved by recreating the
  staging `kaleem` database (pre-launch, no data) and re-running the deploy on
  2026-06-10. VPS-internal readiness check passed; `Deploy complete: blue → green`.

  Getting here also required pushing previously-local-only backend/infra submodule
  commits to their remotes and fixing a ruff pre-commit/CI version skew — see git
  history (backend #1/#2, infra #1, meta #32–#35).
- ✅ Live staging smoke test (register 201 / login-before-verify 400 / unauth 403) after
  wiring production email (AWS SES SMTP, ADR-0016; backend #3, infra #2, meta #37/#39).

## Next

Phase B (per roadmap). Re-read the roadmap spec to confirm the next module before
starting; write its spec (D1) before any code.
